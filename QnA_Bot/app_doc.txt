app.py - Streamlit PDF Q&A Web App
----------------------------------

This script provides a web interface for your PDF Q&A bot using Streamlit.

How it works:
-------------
- Loads precomputed chunks and FAISS index.
- Lets users enter questions in a browser.
- Retrieves relevant chunks using FAISS.
- Sends context and question to Azure OpenAI GPT for an answer.
- Displays the answer in the web interface.

Usage:
------
1. Make sure your `.env` is configured and dependencies are installed.
2. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
3. Open the provided URL in your browser.
4. Type your question and view the answer.

Deployment:
-----------
- Deploy to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) for easy sharing.
- Set your Azure keys and endpoints as secrets in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard.

Notes:
------
- Requires `chunks.pkl` and `faiss_index` to be present (generated by Q&Abot.py).
- Never commit your real `.env` file or Azure keys to public repositories.
