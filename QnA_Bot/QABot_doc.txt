Q&Abot.py - Command-line PDF Q&A Bot
------------------------------------

This script allows you to ask questions about the content of your PDF documents from the command line.

How it works:
-------------
- Loads PDFs from the directory specified in your `.env`.
- Splits documents into text chunks.
- Generates embeddings for each chunk using Azure OpenAI (in batches to avoid rate limits).
- Stores embeddings and chunks locally for fast reruns.
- Uses FAISS for local vector search to find relevant chunks for a user's question.
- Sends the context and question to Azure OpenAI GPT for a full answer.

Usage:
------
1. Make sure your `.env` is configured and dependencies are installed.
2. Run: `python Q&Abot.py`
3. Type your question at the prompt.
4. Type `exit` or `quit` to stop.

Notes:
------
- The first run may take time to process and embed your PDFs.
- Subsequent runs are fast, loading data from disk.
- Only use your own trusted pickle files for FAISS index loading.
